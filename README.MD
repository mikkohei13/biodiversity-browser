Ideas
-----

**Done**

- Interesting species for a give month/year (work in progress)
- Aggragation by data source (work in progress)

Technical Todo
--------------

- Elasticsearch on AWS or elsewhere? (11 GB index for 51M records)
- Async populating of significant species (promises or better UI)
- cache Classes (localstorage?)
- URL Routing (Ember?)
- autocomplete species name
- Reorganize page update logic
- Templating (Handlebars/Ember)

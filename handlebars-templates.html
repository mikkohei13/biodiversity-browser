    <p>This Biodiversity Browser presents biodiversity occurrence data (observations, museum specimens etc.) from Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The data comes from the following GBIF downloads:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li><a href="http://doi.org/10.15468/dl.khgczw">http://doi.org/10.15468/dl.khgczw</a> (Sweden)</li>
    	<li><a href="http://doi.org/10.15468/dl.lcvgjh">http://doi.org/10.15468/dl.lcvgjh</a> (Norway)</li>
    	<li><a href="http://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7nngdw">http://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7nngdw</a> (Denmark)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yearly chart doesn't include data from 2015, since it seems to be only partially available. Majority of Finnish occurrence data is not currently (12/2016) available on GBIF, but will be added here later from <a href="https://beta.laji.fi/">FinBIF</a>.

    <p><strong>The site is a work in progress.</strong> Currently there are tools for displaying: 

    <ul>
	    <li>Species records per year: absolute numbers, or proportionally to a higher taxon (class, order or family; for adjustment to changing observation effort over the years)</li>
	    <li>Species records per month: absolute numbers or proportionally
        <li>Aggregated species distribution maps
	    <li>The largest data sources, and search significant species from each</li>
	    <li>The largest classes, and search significant species from each per year</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The data is stored into an Elasticsearch server, which enables fast searches and aggregations. The browser connects directly to Elasticsearch and formats the results for displaying (with JavaScript, jQuery, Highcharts, Handlebars.js and Leaflet). <a href="https://github.com/mikkohei13/biodiversity-browser">Source code for the Biodiversity Browser is available on Github</a>.

    <p>Data was imported to Elasticsearch by my <a href="https://github.com/mikkohei13/darwincore-php">Darwincore-PHP toolset</a>. 85+ million records took less than four hours to index, and take about 17 GB of hard disk space and 1-4 GB of memory (depending on query load). This shows it's quite feasible to handle even hundreds of millions simple records with a reasonably inexpensive virtual server.
